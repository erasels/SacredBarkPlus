Sacred Bark is a new relic from the beta branch that doubles potion effectiveness. Potions that don't rely on numbers are sadly ignored and don't receive any benefit from this relic.

This mod fixes that.

Every potion that can't have its "potency" doubled can instead be used twice.

This includes the following potions:
Ambrosia
Blessing of the forge
Elixir
Entropic Brew
Gamblers Brew
Smokebomb
Stance potion
